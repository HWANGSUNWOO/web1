  <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer
  program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such
  as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
  and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to
  as coding[1][2]).</p><p style="margin-top:40px;"> The source code of a program is written in one or more programming languages.
  The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the
  performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often
  requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application
  domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
